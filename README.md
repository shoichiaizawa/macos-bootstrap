Mac OS X Bootstrapping via Ansible
==================================

My Ansible playbook to automate provisioning macOS.

About this project
------------------

- This project helps the initial setup for your macOS using Ansible.

###### NOTE:

This project is incomplete in many ways, particularly the `bootstrap.sh` file is not carefully written; hence, it should be used with extra caution. However, please feel free to view my Ansible Playbook settings for my Homebrew and Homebrew Cask.
